        <p>Hello, I am Jessica Casimir. Photography has always been interesting to me. When I was growing up, my family would document everything so that those cherieshed memories would last forever. Starting in 2017, I began to do small photoshoots for friends as a way to make a little extra money on the side. However, photography has allowed me to connect wih others as I use my camera to help faciliate everyone's unique story. Photography has become a passion of mine and I hope that you can experience that passion as you look through this page.</p>
